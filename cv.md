## üè¶ FinTech Experience

**Business Intelligence/Business Analyst/Product Manager** @ [Pragmatic Research LLC]() _(July 2021 - Present)_ <br>
The LLC I set up after accepting Fidelity's Voluntary Buyout!  
Project and Contract work in:
  - Business Intelligence (solving business, compliance, risk and finance data problems)
  - Migration of legacy software to current tech
  - Automation of Business Process
  - **_Technologies used:_** Oracle, Sybase, SQLite, and MySQL;Python, Perl, and PHP; Tableau
<br><br>

**Director, Business Intelligence** @ [Fidelity Capital Markets - Boston, MA]() _(July 2011 - June 2021)_ <br>
Develop and maintain reporting and analysis for the rapidly evolving Management, Product, Financial, Operations, and Compliance demands of the Equity trading business.

Projects were both ad hoc, addressing immediate analytical needs, along with long term development to support quantitative and statistical analysis. Worked with the buy-side business to provide Agency Cross and other required regulatory analyses. Worked with the Risk/Compliance team to provide Reg ATS filing support for the company‚Äôs Dark Pool (CrossStream ATS), along with other initiatives.

The team used an Agile-based approach, supported by JIRA, to migrate a large, legacy content management system (CMS) from a Sybase SQL environment to a firm-standard Oracle environment, revising and enhancing analytical reporting and workflows as part of ongoing development. The new platform provides structured data management, at-a-glance dashboards for multiple businesses (Equities, Fixed Income, etc.), and both ad hoc and scheduled reporting via Excel, Tableau and file delivery to support external company groups.
